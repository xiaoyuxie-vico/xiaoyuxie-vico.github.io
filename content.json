Dimensionless learning for scientific discoveryDimensionless numbers and scaling laws provide elegant insights into the characteristic properties of physical systems. Classical dimensional analysis and similitude theory fail to identify a set of unique dimensionless numbers for a highly-multivariable system with incomplete governing equations. … Read more In this study, we embed the principle of dimensional invariance into a two-level machine learning scheme to automatically discover dominant and unique dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from data. The proposed methodology, called dimensionless learning, can reduce high-dimensional parametric spaces into descriptions involving just a few physically-interpretable dimensionless parameters, which significantly simplifies the process design and optimization of the system. We demonstrate the algorithm by solving several challenging engineering problems with noisy experimental measurements (not synthetic data) collected from the literature. The examples include turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection, vapor depression dynamics in laser melting of metals, and porosity formation in 3D printing. We also show that the proposed approach can identify dimensionally-homogeneous differential equations with minimal parameters by leveraging sparsity-promoting techniques. Xie, X., Liu, W.

Predictive Deep Learning Model for Additive ManufacturingMetal additive manufacturing provides remarkable flexibility in geometry and component design, but localized heating/cooling heterogeneity leads to spatial variations of as-built mechanical properties, significantly complicating the materials design process. … Read more To this end, we develop a mechanistic data-driven framework integrating wavelet transforms and convolutional neural networks to predict location-dependent mechanical properties over fabricated parts based on process-induced temperature sequences, i.e., thermal histories. The framework enables multiresolution analysis and importance analysis to reveal dominant mechanistic features underlying the additive manufacturing process, such as critical temperature ranges and fundamental thermal frequencies. We systematically compare the developed approach with other machine learning methods. The results demonstrate that the developed approach achieves reasonably good predictive capability using a small amount of noisy experimental data. It provides a concrete foundation for a revolutionary methodology that predicts spatial and temporal evolution of mechanical properties leveraging domain-specific knowledge and cutting-edge machine and deep learning technologies.
