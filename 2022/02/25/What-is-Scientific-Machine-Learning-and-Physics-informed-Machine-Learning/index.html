For example, Neural Network is a network composed of a series of structured neurons or nodes. Even though it can be regarded as a universal approximation to any function, it is difficult to explain the relationship for different neurons or nodes. This limitation greatly hinders the development of ML and DL in scientific problems because we desire to discover simple but powerful physical models in these problems, such as Newton’s law or Einstein’s law. Therefore, there is an emerging need to discover explicit and interpretable physical models from data using ML and DL. This emerging field is called <strong>scientific machine learning</strong> or <strong>physics-informed machine learning</strong>.</p>
<p>One typical example is <strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</strong>. The basic idea for PINNs is that since many complex dynamics systems can be described as partial differential equations, PINNs aim to inform Neural Networks with such physical knowledge to solve the equations numerically. Unlike standard ML or DL which generally need to spend a lot of time in preparing a large dataset to train a model, PINNs only need the equations governing the systems and do not need a training set. That is to say, PINNs avoid a time-consuming procedure in data collection.</p>
<p>Another example is <strong>Dimensionless Learning</strong>, which is a physics-informed and explainable machine learning methodology. It aims to find some causal relationships between different variables in a complex system by using another fundamental physical knowledge: the dimensions or units of different variables. By incorporating physical dimensions among variables into machine learning algorithms, it can successfully reduce the high-dimensional parameter space into low-dimensional descriptions. One important advantage of the low-dimensional space is that it can be described as a few physically interpretable dimensionless parameters. Because the parameter space is reduced, dimensionless learning can work well for small datasets effectively.</p>
<p>Despite different formulations of scientific machine learning methods, one common thing is that they want to incorporate our existing physical knowledge into ML to make the train a model efficiently and effectively. After hundreds of years of unremitting efforts of scientists, we already have tons of physical knowledge in various fields. The application of partial differential equations and physical dimensions are just a small part of them. We still have vast physical knowledge waiting to be explored.</p>
