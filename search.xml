    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="About-me"><a href="#About-me" class="headerlink" title="About me"></a>About me</h1><p>There is a quote (with modifications) from the TV show “<em>Westworld</em>“:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people choose to see the chaos and disarray in this world. I choose to see the <strong>beauty</strong>. To believe there is an <strong>order</strong> to our days, a purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, <strong>knowledge is the beauty</strong>. Whether it’s something as “simple” as Newton’s laws of motion (F=ma) or the mass-energy equivalence equation (e=mc^2), mathematical knowledge has the power to explain and improve various aspects of our world, including nature, technology, and culture. Scientists have been using assumptions, hypotheses, and principles to derive equations and discover knowledge for centuries, laying the foundations for our modern world. But this was a process that took decades of labor and effort. </p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to accelerate this process of uncovering hidden patterns and knowledge. However, many AI research efforts focus solely on data-driven approaches, which can result in low interpretability, limited generalization, and reliance on large datasets. These models are prone to inaccuracy and lack methods to explain their failures.</p>
<p>To address these issues, AI needs to incorporate scientific insights, such as partial differential equations and physical invariance, into its algorithms. This integration of existing knowledge, rather than solely relying on data, is what I refer to as <strong>Scientific/Mechanistic Machine Learning</strong> or <strong>AI4Science</strong>. </p>
<p>My research in <strong>Dimensionless Learning</strong> exemplifies this new research direction. We incorporate fundamental physical invariance, such as dimensional invariance, into machine learning to discover three levels of knowledge, including dimensionless numbers at the <strong>feature level</strong>, scaling laws at the <strong>algebraic equation level</strong>, and governing equations at the <strong>differential equation level</strong>.</p>
<p>Moving forward, my research will focus on two directions: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Physics for AI</strong>: incorporating fundamental physical knowledge into AI algorithms to improve interpretability, generalization, and small-dataset scalability;</li>
<li><strong>AI for physics</strong>: developing robust and flexible AI algorithms to discover hidden patterns, equations, and scientific insights from data.</li>

<p>In this study, we embed the principle of dimensional invariance into a two-level machine learning scheme to automatically discover dominant and unique dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from data. The proposed methodology, called dimensionless learning, can reduce high-dimensional parametric spaces into descriptions involving just a few physically-interpretable dimensionless parameters, which significantly simplifies the process design and optimization of the system. We demonstrate the algorithm by solving several challenging engineering problems with noisy experimental measurements (not synthetic data) collected from the literature. The examples include turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection, vapor depression dynamics in laser melting of metals, and porosity formation in 3D printing. We also show that the proposed approach can identify dimensionally-homogeneous differential equations with minimal parameters by leveraging sparsity-promoting techniques.</p>

<p>To this end, we develop a mechanistic data-driven framework integrating wavelet transforms and convolutional neural networks to predict location-dependent mechanical properties over fabricated parts based on process-induced temperature sequences, i.e., thermal histories. The framework enables multiresolution analysis and importance analysis to reveal dominant mechanistic features underlying the additive manufacturing process, such as critical temperature ranges and fundamental thermal frequencies. We systematically compare the developed approach with other machine learning methods. The results demonstrate that the developed approach achieves reasonably good predictive capability using a small amount of noisy experimental data. It provides a concrete foundation for a revolutionary methodology that predicts spatial and temporal evolution of mechanical properties leveraging domain-specific knowledge and cutting-edge machine and deep learning technologies.</p>

    <title>What is Scientific Machine Learning and Physics-informed Machine Learning?</title>
    <url>/2022/02/25/What-is-Scientific-Machine-Learning-and-Physics-informed-Machine-Learning/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have been widely applied in diverse disciplines in science and engineering due to the promising results in image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. However, it is still challenging to discover explicit physical models from data because most ML and DL methods are black-box that cannot be interpreted by human beings. For example, Neural Network is a network composed of a series of structured neurons or nodes. Even though it can be regarded as a universal approximation to any function, it is difficult to explain the relationship for different neurons or nodes. This limitation greatly hinders the development of ML and DL in scientific problems because we desire to discover simple but powerful physical models in these problems, such as Newton’s law or Einstein’s law. Therefore, there is an emerging need to discover explicit and interpretable physical models from data using ML and DL. This emerging field is called <strong>scientific machine learning</strong> or <strong>physics-informed machine learning</strong>.</p>
<p>One typical example is <strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</strong>. The basic idea for PINNs is that since many complex dynamics systems can be described as partial differential equations, PINNs aim to inform Neural Networks with such physical knowledge to solve the equations numerically. Unlike standard ML or DL which generally need to spend a lot of time in preparing a large dataset to train a model, PINNs only need the equations governing the systems and do not need a training set. That is to say, PINNs avoid a time-consuming procedure in data collection.</p>
<p>Another example is <strong>Dimensionless Learning</strong>, which is a physics-informed and explainable machine learning methodology. It aims to find some causal relationships between different variables in a complex system by using another fundamental physical knowledge: the dimensions or units of different variables. By incorporating physical dimensions among variables into machine learning algorithms, it can successfully reduce the high-dimensional parameter space into low-dimensional descriptions. One important advantage of the low-dimensional space is that it can be described as a few physically interpretable dimensionless parameters. Because the parameter space is reduced, dimensionless learning can work well for small datasets effectively.</p>
<p>Despite different formulations of scientific machine learning methods, one common thing is that they want to incorporate our existing physical knowledge into ML to make the train a model efficiently and effectively. After hundreds of years of unremitting efforts of scientists, we already have tons of physical knowledge in various fields. The application of partial differential equations and physical dimensions are just a small part of them. We still have vast physical knowledge waiting to be explored.</p>
